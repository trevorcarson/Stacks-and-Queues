# Stacks-and-Queues
An implementation of Linked Stacks and Queues
Files:
- LList: A minimal implementation of a linked list to be used for creating a stack and a queue.
- LNode: A class for representing nodes of data in a linked collection.
- LQueue: An efficient queue implementation using linked nodes
- LStack: An efficient stack implementation using linked nodes as storage
- PrefixPostfix: A class for evaluating expressions in prefix and postfix notation

Learned Principles:
- How to manipulate and create a Stack and Queue data structure from scratch.
- How using a linked list as the base data structure to create 
- PrefixPostfix was a challenging program that could only be implemented with a solid understanding of how stacks and queues work. It uses the idea of cycling through a queue, or pushing all elements of a queue onto a stack, to evaluate basic arithmetic operations.

I've written code to implement Stacks and Queues using arrays as well as linked lists. This code uses linked lists as the data structure.
